# Hello-world
My repository

My name is Marc. I'm a 18 year old (as of the 18th of December) and genuinely have no clue what I'm doing with my life.
Coding sounded cool. I like to type and use my head noodle so software development seemed like a decent fit. 

I'm also currently dating a masochist, so I'm sure some of that has imbued itself into me via osmosis. 

Note: 
Dear future Marc,

I hope you've sharpened your gaze on your anal fettish. Shit needs to be known, it's okay to admit it. 
Love u -.-
